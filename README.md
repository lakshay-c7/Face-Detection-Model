Face Detection Model using TensorFlow and VGG16

Project Overview

This repository contains a face detection model developed with TensorFlow and leveraging the VGG16 neural network architecture. The model aims to identify and locate human faces within an image accurately. The implementation includes image augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness and utilizes the Functional API of Keras for model construction.

Features

Face Detection: Identify and locate human faces in a variety of imaging conditions.
TensorFlow Integration: Utilize TensorFlow 2.x for efficient model training and execution.
VGG16 Architecture: Employ the VGG16 model for robust feature extraction.
Image Augmentation: Implement image augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
Model Evaluation: Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib for visualizing training results and detection performance.

Results

Our face detection model, leveraging TensorFlow and the VGG16 architecture, has demonstrated promising performance with an accuracy rate of 85% during testing. This metric indicates that the model effectively recognizes and localizes faces in a variety of images with high reliability.

Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of 85%, which means it correctly identifies and locates faces in 85 out of every 100 images tested.
